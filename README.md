# Bittrex Command-Line Trader
## Andre V. Banks

!!!Project Not Complete!!!
A command-line application for Mac OS that enables coin tradring through Bittrex on the CLI. To run the application it needs to be granted execution permission this can be done by running the following command in the directory of the "cli_trader.py" file  ```
chmod u+x cli_trader.py ```    
The application can now be run by running the cli_trader.py file  
```./cli_trader.py```  
I would recommend creating a symlink of the ```cli_trader.py``` file to ```/usr/local/bin/COMMAND_NAME``` so the application can be ran by calling a designated command. This can be done by running the following command ```ln -s FULL_PATH/cli_trader.py /user/local/bin/COMMAND_NAME``` replacing 'FULL_PATH' with the full path of the file and 'COMMAND_NAME' with the desired command name. A secrets.py file needs to be created which will hold the API key and secrety generated from Bittrex. The cli_trader.py file contains a global variable 'LOT' this determines what dollar lots the coins should be traded.  The default value is 5 which means coins will be traded in $5 USD lots.  This functionality makes trading between coins a lot easier to deal with.  Due to the extremely volatile nature of Bitcoin I find pricing purchase size in USD a lot easier.   


## Commands
